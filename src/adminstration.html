Carved out of rock, the subterranean monoliths include huge Bete Medhane Alem, and cross-shaped Bete Giyorgis. Many are joined by tunnels and trenches, and some have carved bas-reliefs and colored frescoes inside.</td>

It has around 300 stelae, some of which are phallic stelae, thought to date from the 9th century and some of which are anthropomorphic stelae, which are believed to be from the 12th century. Excavation at the site has revealed artefacts ranging from iron and copper bracelets to pottery, beads and tools, which were buried alongside the occupant.</td>

It constitutes a spectacular example of a living cultural tradition stretching back 21 generations (more than 400 years) adapted to its dry hostile environment. The landscape demonstrates the shared values, social cohesion and engineering knowledge of its communities. The site also features anthropomorphic wooden statues - grouped to represent respected members of their communities and particularly heroic events - which are an exceptional living testimony to funerary traditions that are on the verge of disappearing. Stone steles in the towns express a complex system of marking the passing of generations of leaders.</td>
